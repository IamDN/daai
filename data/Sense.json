      "description": "The notion of 'sense' in urban planning has gained increasing attention in recent years, driven by a growing recognition of the importance of sensory experiences in shaping urban environments.The concept of sense transcends mere physical attributes of spaces, extending into the realms of perception, experience, and engagement of individuals within those environments. It encompasses how people perceive their surroundings and how these perceptions influence their interactions with urban spaces. Understanding the nuances of sense is vital for creating cities that are not only functional but also resonate with the inhabitants' needs and aspirations.",
