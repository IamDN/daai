    "description": "The notion of 'coalitions' in urban planning is pivotal to understanding various dimensions of urban life and development. 'Coalitions' addresses critical aspects such as perception, utility, and the social and physical dynamics that shape urban spaces. By examining coalitions, urban planners and researchers can create more inclusive, adaptive, and responsive environments. The concept extends to understanding the needs, limits, and potentials within urban contexts to enhance the lived experiences and interactions of individuals.",
